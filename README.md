# IMDB Sentiment Transformer

## Project Overview
IMDB Sentiment Transformer is a deep learning-based sentiment analysis tool designed to classify IMDB movie reviews. Using state-of-the-art transformer models, it accurately predicts whether a review is positive or negative, providing valuable insights for the film industry and audiences.

## Key Features
- Leverages advanced transformer models (BERT) for sentiment classification
- Processes and analyzes IMDB movie reviews
- High accuracy in sentiment prediction (85% average)
- User-friendly web interface for review input and sentiment analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Streamlit
- Flask
- NumPy, Pandas

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing of IMDB reviews
2. Feature extraction using BERT embeddings
3. Model fine-tuning for sentiment classification
4. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
- Average accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 87%
- Recall: 83%
- F1-score: 85%

## Future Directions
- Explore additional transformer architectures
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved performance
- Expand to multi-class sentiment analysis
